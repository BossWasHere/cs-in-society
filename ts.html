            <hr />
            <p>
              Those with a small fortune to spare have always had the option to
              purchase only the most expensive, meticulously designed jewelry,
              encrusted by diamonds and plated by gold. For many people, jewelry
              signifies something important; be it marriage, the birth of a
              child or anything personal to the wearer. But we can get more
              personal than this.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Digital tools</em> now give people the freedom to make their
              own designs and use their own patterns for their jewelry. Tanmay
              Shah, head of innovation at a company called Imaginarium in
              Mumbai, India said “Not just that, but the piece could be embedded
              with an NFT tag, which, when read by a smartphone, could trigger
              memories and digital memorabilia of the family, almost like a time
              capsule.”

            <h5>How did this become possible?</h5>
            <p>
              Over the last few decades, improvements to Computer Aided Design
              software (and the power of the machines they run on) means that
              designers can get realtime renders of their designs and make as
              many changes to their jewels as they want. A lot of hardware
              involved in CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) allows for the most
              complex of designs to be replicated perfectly in real life.
              Techniques such as metal 3D printing, a novel idea to most people,
              have been heavily researched and improved upon, yielding high
              quality results particuarly when it is needed in the jewelry
              business.
