  <h1>Japan's technology leads the way in caring for the elderly</h1>
  <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <li>
      During the last sixty years across the globe, the number of people living longer over
      the age of</br> sixty-five has doubled, from 5% to 9% and Japan has been one of the
      front runners.</br></br> The acceleration of aging is more remarkable in Japan than elsewhere:
      more than a quarter of the</br> population is 65 or older.</br></br> People are living longer and
      above all, living better. In Japan the newest technologies have </br>inspired public and
      private sectors in the fields of health policies and innovation, to provide older</br>
      people a better quality of life.</br></br>
    </li>
  <h2>Japan's digital care system</h2>
    <li>
      An aging society is a serious challenge for healthcare systems. Solutions delivered by Japan were </br>at the core of an international summit in Tokyo, which gathered worldwide medical experts,</br> public officials, start-ups and foreign delegations.</br></br>
      A digital care system has been the centrepiece of the Japanese strategy. It has been merging</br> medical data and technology.</br></br>
      <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=3dWDnnYAAAAJ&hl=en">Erwin BÃ¶ttinger</a> , Head of Digital Health Centre, Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany is one </br>of the main world experts in digital health innovation and said, "I am totally impressed by what is </br>happening in Japan, here."</br></br>
      "The benefits of digitisation, the benefits of Artificial Intelligence for our citizens and our societies </br>will be greatest in the way of improved healthcare, and improved health in the distant future: that </br>this requires that we have a good relationship with our own data."</br></br>
    </li>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
    <li>
      Japan is establishing a new regulation to allow public and private sectors to use anonymously </br>processed medical data.</br></br>
      To see how this digital transition has been implemented Euronews went to the <a href="https://www.kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp/english/">University</br> Hospital</a> in Kyoto.</br></br>

      The collection of records begins from the patient's bedroom. Nurses pass on information straight</br> to the servers, such as blood pressure, heartbeat, body temperature, clinical tests, and</br> treatments.</br></br>
      Processing this cluster of data allows medical care to be more precise and more efficient. It also</br> provides insights on how the healthcare system is managing and what's driving medicine</br> production.</br></br>
      Tomohiro Kuroda CIO and Professor, Kyoto University Hospital said, "We collect data to</br> understand what is happening in this country and what kind of medical treatment we provide to</br> people."</br></br>
      "By using this data, we can see the different treatment and care. We make this data anonymous,</br> and the government prepares a system to share it with everyone. Then, through this system, the </br>private sector can use the data in order to create new drugs and treatments," Kuroda added.</br></br>
      Japanese healthcare insurance relies on billions of data, from more than 126 million citizens. It's a</br> unique set of data that could be a source of opportunities even outside of the country.</br></br>
      Genta Kato, Chief Content, Kyoto University Hospital Solution Centre for Health Insurance Claims</br> said, "More than 95% of the Japanese population's care content is covered by data elaboration.</br> There is a 'trend' to using both medical treatment and nursing care data as a whole package for</br> digital healthcare."</br></br>
      "Japan is a super-ageing society, and I think that our knowledge in this process could be a </br>reference for many other countries in the world," added Kato.
